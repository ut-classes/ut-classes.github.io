# Web Programming Application 2023

<p>한국교통대학교, 충주<small> | KNUT (Korea National University of Transportation)</small></p>

---

### Overview / 수업 개요

Node.js is used to build web servers in Javascript, and there are numerous pre-built packages available through npm. This class follows 8 programming projects listed in the book and requires students to work on a 9th personal project at the end of the class. Topics such as development process, security, database management (Mongoose), user account authentication, and production deployment are covered. You will also learn about debugging asynchronous code, data models, and Javascript modules.

### Objectives

Understand CRUD functions in web servers and websites with Node.js and Express, learn to implement chatting and other interactive functions, and learn English expressions suitable for the international era.

The course will be delivered as a series of 2-hour lectures (with a break in the middle), followed by practice lab sessions where students will apply the lessons in a series of instructor-guided exercises using the provided starter code as part of the exercises. The course will cover the following topics:

- running Node.js applications and creating Node.js modules
- building web servers in Node.js and Express.js and handling routing
- connecting to MongoDB to serve data and the Controller, Model, View paradigm
- handling CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functions in Node.js
- creating user accounts and authenticating users
- building an API and adding API security
- adding chat functionality with Socket.io
- deploying and managing code in production

## Lectures, practice, and assignments

- Lectures: Lectures will be held for 2 hours every Friday.
- Practice time: Students will be given the final hour of each lecture period to practice what was covered in the lecture.
- Assignments: Students will be required to turn in assignments in GitHub Classroom ([am](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/126310482-2023sp-259122-1-am) / [pm](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/126310482-2023sp-259122-2-pm)).

See the Google Classroom [am](https://classroom.google.com/c/NTEyMjUxMTM4MjQz?cjc=m5cbuja) / [pm](https://classroom.google.com/c/NTE2NTcyNjcwNjMz?cjc=sr6x7hg) for class PPTs, lists, and announcements.

### Preparing for the course

You will need NodeJS and a basic code editor or IDE for this course. You will need to download and install [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and a code editor such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) on your computer.

**Detailed instructions can also be found [here](https://ut-nodejs.github.io/instructions) for installing the tools you need and working with the lab materials.**

If you are not already familiar with JavaScript, HTML, or CSS, you are strongly encouraged to attempt to become familiar before the start of the course. That way, you will spend much less time becoming familiar with the tools, and will be able to focus more on the methods. The following links provide basic introductions to web programming, which you can study at your own pace before the course begins.

- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element)
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference)
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide)
- [How much JavaScript do you need to know to use NodeJS?](https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/how-much-javascript-do-you-need-to-know-to-use-nodejs/)

You are also strongly recommended to spend some time before the course working through the following materials related to working with git and GitHub and turning in homework:

- [git - 간편 안내서](https://up1.github.io/git-guide/index.ko.html)
- [누구나 쉽게 이해할 수 있는 git 입문](https://backlog.com/git-tutorial/kr/)
